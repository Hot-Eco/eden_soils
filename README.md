# Eden soil carbon and nitrogen
Analysis of total soil carbon and nitrogen in relation to fire and logging treatments. 
GAMs were used to allow for non-linear responses, with sites treated as random effects.
All working R code is in Rmarkdown documents, with the code for the main analyses in 
the file eden_gams.Rmd.
